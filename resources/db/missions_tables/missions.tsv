objective_inv_insubres_1_primary	false	Diplomacy is a useful tool for achieving political goals. Its virility, however, depends on the strength of our tribe. However, to be successful during the talks we must first be effective with our boots - it is wise to control the territories in our immediate vicinity.	The Tale of Our Kin (Temporal Cycle I)	CAPTURE_REGIONS	rom_event_mission.png	barb_faction.png	false
objective_inv_insubres_2_primary	false	Securing the mountain ranges to the east should protect us from unpleasant surprises, as some of the local tribes are traditionally inclined to show up unannounced and cause damage.

objective_inv_insubres_4_primary	false	With the growth of our domains, the responsibilities and glory of our leaders have risen in tandem.

objective_inv_insubres_5_primary	false	The south is proud and ambitious; Etruscans and Romans, Italians and Greeks all scramble there, vying for superiority.

objective_inv_insubres_6_primary	false	We control a vast domain, which allows us to shape the world according to our choices.

objective_inv_insubres_7_primary	false	Brennus' greatness is unchallenged. His conduct, on the other hand, invites criticism: his inclination to sell his sword to the highest bidder makes him an unreliable ally; his passion for sacking cities has made him a hated brute.

objective_inv_iolei_1_primary	false	Sardinia is our home, generous in food and water. Her forests provide wood and shelter, her coasts, wealth and safety.

objective_inv_iolei_2_primary	false	The Balearic island of Corsica lies in our backyard. Its resources are dismissively small but its importance for our safety is paramount.

In the Light of Sardus (Age II)	CAPTURE_REGIONS	rom_event_mission.png	inv_sardinian_faction.png	false
objective_inv_iolei_3_primary	false	Our roots are strong yet insular.

objective_inv_iolei_4_primary	false	With the expansion of our territories we are starting to encounter tribes and cities with different cultures and strange deities.

objective_inv_iolei_5_primary	false	New lands lie before us, fertile and favourable in terrain.

objective_inv_iolei_6_primary	false	We have become quite efficient at showing up unexpectedly at the coastal cities of eastern Italy! This tactic keeps our warriors, as well as our rivals, on their toes. Just beyond the horizon, to the east, lies Latium, and to the south, Carthage. To arms!	In the Light of Sardus (Age VI)	CAPTURE_REGIONS	rom_event_mission.png	inv_sardinian_faction.png	false
objective_inv_iolei_7_primary	false	What goes around, comes around - as someone may have once said. We have begun our ascent by curbing the ambitions of Carthage in Sardinia.

objective_inv_rome_1_primary	false	It has been ten years since military hostilities began between us and the Etruscan city of Veii.

The Annals of Rome (Chapter I)	CAPTURE_REGIONS	rom_event_mission.png	rom_faction.png	false
objective_inv_rome_2_primary	false	The Latin people are our cousins. The people of the mountains, on the other hand, are more of a pain in the neck than an itch. They both hold territories in immediate proximity to Rome. Obviously, it is in their interests to partner with us... and be a protective buffer.	The Annals of Rome (Chapter II)	CAPTURE_REGIONS	rom_event_mission.png	rom_faction.png	false
objective_inv_rome_3_primary	false	Our horizons widen. To the south lie territories with fertile lands and rich coastal waters; to the north, barbarians roam the hills.

objective_inv_rome_4_primary	false	The quality and variety of entertainment in a society is proof of its greatness and eminence.

objective_inv_rome_5_primary	false	We have been looking at Magna Graecia, with its rolling pastures, rich soils and abundance of useful resources.

objective_inv_rome_7_primary	false	We've learned a lot from them. In our infancy, we learned civilisation from their example and their strength deterred the others' ambitions against us.

The Annals of Rome (Chapter VII)	CAPTURE_REGIONS	rom_event_mission.png	rom_faction.png	false
objective_inv_samnites_1_primary	false	The mountains are our home, providing us with everything we need. The sea coast, however, offers riches far beyond our current means.

Echoes of the Mountains (Chapter I)	CAPTURE_REGIONS	rom_event_mission.png	rom_faction.png	false
objective_inv_samnites_2_primary	false	The fertile lands of Magna Graecia enable steady agricultural production for relatively little effort.

objective_inv_samnites_3_primary	false	The rest of Southern Italy lies before us, fertile and well populated. The only hinderance to our expansion has a Greek face.

objective_inv_samnites_4_primary	false	Keep your oaths and the gods will reward you - it is not a surprise, therefore, that we have grown and prospered.

objective_inv_samnites_5_primary	false	The north is still untamed - dangers of different kinds lurk in the shadows.
