3c_Faction_Leader_Aurelian_1	true	My helm feels heavy today. Oddly uncomfortable, its weight causes an annoying itch that crawls around my scalp and down my ears. The itch is the only thing I can think of. The scraping of thousand tiny fingers along my skin. I have to take the Sun Mask off, I have to find relief from this torment, yet a troop review is in progress; the eyes of my soldiers are upon me. My discomfort seems to be obvious, as Mucapor quietly asks me if there is anything wrong.	The Man in the Armour - Part I	rom_event_document.png	3c_rom_aurelian.png	true
3c_Faction_Leader_Aurelian_2	true	This Illyrian is an exceptional fighter. Only today I watched him best five men in training bouts. What moved me to challenge him I cannot say. The training sword feels heavy yet obedient in my hand. The Illyrian is young and nimble, yet cannot match my experience. Our swords clash a few times, then I exploit a momentary loss of balance. He goes down in the dust and as I approach, I see his eyes go wide with utter fear. There is only one way to end this.	The Man in the Armour - Part II	rom_event_document.png	3c_rom_aurelian.png	true
3c_Faction_Leader_Aurelian_3	true	The boy seems unfazed by the burly soldiers flanking him. "Indomitable Aurelian," says one of the Legionaries. "We caught this here thief, sneaking around our food supplies. We asked him what he was doing here - he says he wanted to see the man with the iron face." The boy nods at his words. His clothes are tattered, his face smeared with dirt, yet there is an air of defiance around him. I feel both annoyed and intrigued.

3c_Faction_Leader_Aurelian_4	true	I have told him he has lived for too long yet I am yet to devise a fitting punishment for his corruption. And now he cowers in fear, a scrawny rat before a cat. The parchment I ripped from his hands hisses open. A list of names, my signature inscribed below. I glance at my secretary. His lower lip trembles with fright. It dawns on me... filthy conspirator! He is about to turn my closest friends against me!	The Man in the Armour - Part IV	rom_event_document.png	3c_rom_aurelian.png	true
3c_Faction_Leader_Cannabaudes_1	true	An evening of merrymaking. Mead is flowing. Stories of terror and glory ring about. Then a young man speaks to me. I know him. Geberic, a worthy swordsman of the Greuthungi. He proclaims: "Cannabaudes, chief with silver hair, tell us all. How did you come across your wolf-cloak?" I stare at the fire for a few heartbeats. Then I tell the story of a...	Stories of the Elder - Part I	rom_event_document.png	3c_barb_cannabaudes.png	true
3c_Faction_Leader_Cannabaudes_2	true	The fire roars in the hearth. Meat sizzles. The wind is howling outside. Talk is hushed. Then, Geberic slowly stands up. His recent wound glows red on his forehead. He says: "Cannabaudes, sworn enemy of Rome, tell us all. When did you first fight the Romans?" I draw a deep breath. Then I tell the story of a...

3c_Faction_Leader_Cannabaudes_3	true	The singer is a good one but his song is in some hellish dialect. I don't understand every word, though he sings about Cniva. This irritates me. The song is finally over and the hall erupts with cheering as my warriors praise the singer. Then Geberic steps forth. The wound on his forehead is healing well. He addresses me: "Tell us, oh, do tell us, good Reiks Cannabaudes! Tell us of Cniva, the Knife of the Gothi!" I smile and begin the story of a...

3c_Faction_Leader_Cannabaudes_4	true	Tonight, I am the last to stay by the dying fire. I watch the embers. I think of yesterday, today, tomorrow. Silent steps approach. I lift my gaze. It's Geberic. Has the time come? Will he try to slay me, to claim my reikdom? Where is my weapon? He sits before me, hands laid out in his lap. His wound is but a scar. He asks: "Tell me, Cannabaudes. Tell me, what future do you have for us?" I turn my eyes to the embers. I then say a single word - ...	Stories of the Elder - Part IV	rom_event_document.png	3c_barb_cannabaudes.png	true
3c_Faction_Leader_Hormizd_1	true	Kartir, the priest, is a fascinating source of wisdom. Each conversation I have with him is utterly delightful. I am never sure whether he jests or  is serious or puts my knowledge to some kind of test. Our current situation is a perfect example. We have been discussing horse breeds when he smiles and abruptly changes the subject. "Tell me, oh magnificent lord, tell me, a single word that means freedom. A noun if it pleases you." I think for a bit and answer...	Talks with Kartir - Part I	rom_event_document.png	3c_east_hormizd.png	true
3c_Faction_Leader_Hormizd_2	true	As Kartir begins his story, he takes a small sip of wine, wincing at its sharp taste. "Once upon a time, my gracious lord, there was a king of an old desert kingdom. One day, as he was out for a stroll in his royal garden, he beheld a sight most curious. A bird sat perched on a tree branch. As big as a peacock, its feathers were flames of summer sunset, its eyes the colour of gems - one ruby and the other emerald, to be precise. Its song was sad yet jubilant, it touched the very heart of a man. The king stopped to listen to the song and then..." He pauses and looks at me intently. "Tell me, my king almighty, what would you have done if you were in his stead?" The answer comes instantly - such a bird needed to be...

3c_Faction_Leader_Hormizd_3	true	Today's conversation is surely a test, or so it seems. Without further ado, Kartir lays out on the table between us four objects: a dagger, a quill pen, a single coin and a simple iron crown. I am puzzled and my face shows it. Kartir smiles and bows to me. "Do have a look at these four items, oh most majestic and exalted one. Then answer my simple question: which of these is the most dangerous?" I hesitate little before pointing at the... 	Talks with Kartir - Part III	rom_event_document.png	3c_east_hormizd.png	true
3c_Faction_Leader_Hormizd_4	true	Tonight Kartir is in a solemn mood. After talking at length about old philosophers, he leans forward and whispers intently. "Yes, the name, noble lord of near and distant, the name is the essence of an object. If we consider a person, the noble man is given always a noble name, is it not?" He continues before I manage to disagree. "Permit me this question then, oh most majestic of kings. If you were to choose your name, what name would you set for you?" The question seems to carry a heavy weight for the priest. I give it some thought and the speak the name...	Talks with Kartir - Part IV	rom_event_document.png	3c_east_hormizd.png	true

3c_Faction_Leader_Zenobia_1	true	The moth is as big as my palm. Its wings flap like banners in high wind as it circles the lamp in the corner of the hall. Wahballat draws near me, his eyes aglow with astonishment and disgust. "A djinn, a djinn," says he, and grips my knee with his tiny hands. The word feels like a bony finger crawling along my spine, yet I remain calm. "It's just a night moth, pupil of my eye. You only need to...

3c_Faction_Leader_Zenobia_4	true	The merchant kneels in the middle of the hall. His mumblings of mercy are drowned the angry murmur of the courtiers around him. Wahballat sits on the royal throne, pale and rigid. He knows he is to judge the man before him. He also knows what a conspirator against his mother deserves, yet seems hesitant to state the verdict.
